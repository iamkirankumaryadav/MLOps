# **MLOps Architecture**

### 1. Data Management:
- This component focuses on data collection, cleaning, preprocessing and versioning.
- It ensures that high-quality data is available for model training and testing.

### 2. Model Development:
- The model development component covers tasks such as model training, evaluation and versioning.
- It involves selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning hyperparameters and assessing model performance.

### 3. Model Deployment: 
- Model deployment involves packaging ML models into containers or deployment artefacts.
- Orchestrating their deployment and setting up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

### 4. Monitoring and Logging: 
- This component ensure real-time monitoring of deployed models, capturing performance metrics and logging of relevant events and predictions.
- It facilitates issue detection, debugging and performance optimization.

### 5. Model Governance and Compliance: 
- Model governance ensures that models adhere to regulatory and ethical guidelines.
- It involves version control, documentation and maintaining data privacy and security standards.
