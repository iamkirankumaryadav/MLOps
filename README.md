# **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)**

A set of practices that aim to streamline and automate the process of deploying and managing ML models in production environments.

### **Key components of MLOps include:**

1. **Data management:** Efficiently handling, cleaning, and preparing data for model training and deployment.
2. **Model development:** Building and training ML models using various algorithms and techniques.
3. **Model deployment:** Deploying trained models into production environments, making them accessible for real-time predictions.
4. **Monitoring:** Continuously tracking model performance and identifying potential issues or degradation.
5. **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks like data ingestion, model training, and deployment to improve efficiency.

### **Benefits of MLOps:**
1. **Faster time to market:** Accelerate the process of getting ML models into production skipping the manual process.
2 **Improved model quality:** Ensure that models are reliable, consistent and perform as expected in real-world scenarios.
3 **Enhanced collaboration:** Foster collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders involved in the ML lifecycle.
4 **Reduced operational costs:** Streamline the management and maintenance of ML models by reducing cost and time.
5 **Increased agility:** Enable organizations to respond quickly to changing business needs and market conditions.

### **MLOps Tools & Frameworks:**

1. **Kubeflow:** A platform for building and deploying ML workflows on Kubernetes.
