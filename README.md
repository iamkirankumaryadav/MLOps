# MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)
A set of practices that aim to streamline and automate the entire ML lifecycle, from development to deployment and maintenance.

### Steps of Lifecycle
- Data Management: Extract, transform, load, ingest (Data from multiple sources)
- Feature Engineering: Select, extract, and create new features.
- Data Pipeline: Validate, clean, standardise, curate, encode, handle missing data, outliers, duplicates etc.
- Model Development: Code, train, validate, evaluate, optimize, fine-tune, retrain, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
- Model Deployment: Build, deploy, containerise, package, code versioning (GitHub, Gitlab, Bit Bucket), CI/CD, etc.
- Monitor, track metrics, errors, workflow, lineage, audit, automate, refine, release, register models, etc.
- Serve: UI, API, integrate, application or service for the users, etc
- Sustenance and Infrastructure Management

### Benefits of MLOps
1. **Faster time to market:** Accelerate getting ML models into production skipping the manual process and dependencies.
2. **Improved model quality:** Ensure that models are reliable, consistent and perform as expected in real-world scenarios.
3. **Enhanced collaboration:** Foster collaboration between data scientists, engineers, analysts, and other stakeholders.
4. **Reduced operational costs:** Streamline the management and maintenance of ML models by reducing cost and time.
5. **Increased agility:** Enable organizations to respond quickly to changing business needs and market conditions.
